Project 1
--------------

Aim: Create a computational pipeline to identify, characterize, and compare neural activity in the whole brain of stimuli versus
control fish.

Code word is first.

@
REG -- There is a previous implementation of affine registration developed by Koester lab. Understand the algorithm. Employ it
in a pipeline. Use it to register control and stimuli brains. Think about ways to evaluate and improve the algorithm.
@
MASK -- Develop a masking tool to define the to-be-segmented region, i.e. exclude eyes etc.
@
SEGM -- Understand the segmentation algorithm and code that was previously developed and employ it in a pipeline to segement control
and stimuli brains.
@
MORPH -- Employ ANTS in a pipeline to register brains onto their corresponding reference and morph registered brains onto the
elavl3:H2B-RFP reference from z-brain.
@
MORPH_EVAL -- Determine accuracy of morphing using point-based landmarks and cell masks as described in Marquart et al, 2017.
GigaScience 6(8), 1-15.
@
VIZ -- Visualize dF/F values of cells/ROIs on every plane (21 in total) for individual control and stimuli brains on top of the
recorded CGaMP activity as has been previously done in Ahrens et al. (2013). Nature Methods 10(5), 413-420. Visualize dF/F values of
cells/ROIs for an average control and stimuli brain comprising n individual fish.
@
ML -- Apply machine learning techniques (unsupervised, supervised) to identify different response patterns in stimuli versus control
brains.
@
CHAR -- Characterize identified neural populations using z-brain marker lines, e.g. are the identified cells dopaminergic,
GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic etc.
@
LAB_HELP -- Helping people at the lab with Python.
@
READ_LIT -- Reading research literature, neuroscience and algorithms books.
@
READ_CODE -- Reading code from other people's github repositories.
@
BLOG -- Composing material for a neural data science blog.
@
MAN -- manual work with data: labeling for ML, segmenting fish etc.
@
ONLINE_C -- learning through online courses.
@
CONF -- conferences.
@
TR -- training.
@
PRES -- prepare and give presentations.
@
MICRS -- learning about optics.
@
TENSOR -- tensor decomposition.
