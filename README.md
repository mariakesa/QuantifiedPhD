# QuantifiedPhD

I started my PhD in Neuroscience at TU Braunschweig in the September of 2020. I believe that attempting to solve a problem without a strategy may lead to a lot of work without producing a correct solution. That's why I decided to track my use of time and projects. I decided to make .txt documents that would be easy to parse with Python and would allow me to use Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze my progress. 

projects.txt file contains a description of projects and their main subtasks coded by codewords. timeline.txt is a file that encodes the time I spend on a subtask of a project every day. timeline.txt is very easily parsable by a simple python script.

I hope this project will help me be more systematic in my work!
